# 📊 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

Welcome to the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project! 🚀 This project aims to predict whether a tweet expresses **positive** 😊 or **negative** 😞 sentiment. We've built a machine learning model using **Logistic Regression** and vectorized the tweet text using **TF-IDF**. The model is wrapped in a user-friendly **Streamlit app** for easy interaction!

## 📋 Project Overview

In this project, we analyze tweets to classify them as either positive or negative. This sentiment analysis can be helpful in various use cases such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and brand reputation management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Logistic Regression 📉
- **Vectorization Technique**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) 🧮
- **Web App Framework**: Streamlit 🖥️

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We use a dataset of tweets with positive and negative sentiments. The text is cleaned and preprocessed before being fed into the model.
2. **Vectorization**: We convert the tweet text into numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. **Classification**: The Logistic Regression model predicts whether the tweet is **positive** or **negative**.
4. **Streamlit App**: A simple app interface where users can input a tweet and get an instant prediction of its sentiment.
